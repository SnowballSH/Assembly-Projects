## Assembly Projects

I've learned Python, Ruby, Javascript, Typescript to Go, C, Rust in one year pretty easily.

However, x86 Assembly is a nightmare.

Yes. Nightmare.

```asm
mov rdx, rax
mov rax, rbx
add rbx, rdx
dec cx
jnz turn
```

Fibonacci looks like this in Assembly. I am really, really confused.

That is why I created this repo. I post my progress in learning assembly here!
